Calculator functions


Write a simple text using Django.
a test using test driven development.

Create the test first and then we're going to add the functionality that
the tests that drive the development.

Write the test for the behavior you expect to see in the code.
And then that test is going to fail because you haven't written the code yet.
Then you're going to go back and you're going to write the code.

So the test passes.
